# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I built this project to further my strengths in coding, and to work towards a goal in web and software development.  This project shows what I have learned over the course of this prework assignment, and makes a reference to what these different coding languages are.  I learned the basics of three coding languages (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), and how to structure code in these languages.

In this Prework Study Guide, you can find the different notes of how you can use each of these languages for coding a Web page.  Whether this is to format your paragraphs on a web page, to see if JavaScript is running with Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows) in the ChromeDev tools.
